This project contains interactive visualizations that help explain core machine learning concepts using the p5.js JavaScript library.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To make AI more accessible and intuitive by showing how algorithms like perceptrons and clustering work in real time â€” no machine learning background required!

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Perceptron Decision Boundary Demo
- ðŸš§ More demos coming soon (K-Means, Neural Networks, etc.)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-visual-demos.git
